## Founder Quote

Inspired by the work of Ken Robinson, co founder Delyth Johnson says 
> “This Changed Me is borne from my life and my own frustration at procrastination, and not really knowing where my passions and interests were.  I wanted to create something fun and accessible which could help people break through their own barriers to change so they could discover more of themselves.  There is no difference between me and you, if I can do it, so can you, and vice versa.  If we give it a go, whatever it is, then amazing things can happen: the discovery of new passions; talents; people; places; and how we feel about ourselves... When we have people inspiring and encouraging us, it can get that little bit easier”.


## Our Story

Launched on 1 January 2015 on the App Store, This Changed Me is an inspiring and ambitious app.  With three co-founders; Delyth Johnson with a desire to help people find their passions, talents and live their dreams; Nic Mulvaney a talented [interaction designer](http://www.nicmulvaney.com) and [musician](http://www.compulsiverecords.com/) and Chris Barnes; [graphic designer](http://www.welldoneus.com/), [artist](http://chrisbarnesart.tumblr.com/) and [bee keeper](http://www.barnesandwebb.com).  Having met 14 years ago working for an interactive design agency ‘Digit’ and remaining friends ever since, life serendipitously brought Delyth and Nic together as temporary flatmates where the flickering light of This Changed Me burst into the ether! Chris joined forces 3 months later after returning from years of travels.

This Changed Me is a reflection of Delyth’s life in some respects; her frustration of not knowing what to do, or what her talents were, feeling uncreative, struggling to make her dreams happen, a theme that rings true for a lot of people.  And is also borne from a previous life as a Nutritional Therapist where she discovered her love and passion of working with client’s barriers to change or perception... and how by addressing these we can work through the blocks and discover talents, passions, inspiration and new lives.   Delyth had an idea of creating an app where people could share the things that had changed their lives, for the better, to inspire a change in others too.  The experience was to feel positive and inspirational, to be accessible for all, to be a grass roots community of people helping each other out, it was to be fun and also innovative. 

Hours were spent around kitchen tables at weekends, nursing hangovers at times, talking and developing This Changed Me while working on other projects or full time work.  The end result being a beta version which launched on the app store, and is really a niche social media based app which focuses on sharing those experiences/moments/life changes which have had a powerful positive effect on you.

Changes are big or small.  Changing something which feels small in our life like reducing caffeine can have a momentous impact on how you feel, this can inspire someone else to make small but fundamental changes to their lives.  In contrast big changes which can take years of preparation, commitment and focus, are also hugely inspirational to someone else.  

And this is what This Changed Me is about - sharing to inspire, to encourage someone else to make a change, which in turn could help them feel fulfilled, positive, passionate, alive.  By fulfilling ourselves, this is what contributes to make a community, a society and a world become a more positive place.
